# IntroPatch
Plugin for Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix+ version 1.03 (multiversion/sigscanning will be implemented at a later date).

Skips the intro and title screens.
Also serves as a workaround for a random crash that occurs after clicking on the title screen on macOS Sonoma beta with the Game Porting Toolkit.

Requires DivaModLoader: https://github.com/blueskythlikesclouds/DivaModLoader
